                I'm <span class="highlight">Muhammad Hadi Mughal</span>, currently an 18-year-old second-year A Level student. This is a simple webpage I made for a Hack Club project (and also to get free boba tea :D). I'm bilingual, with Urdu as my native language and fluency in English. I'm very passionate about programming, cybersecurity, and math. My main programming languages of choice are C++ and Python.
                <br><br>
                As you scroll through this webpage, I'll showcase some of the projects I've worked on (and am currently working on).

            So, I'm really fond of Linux. More specifically, I'm really fond of Linux's speed. I use a pretty weak Lenovo X1 Carbon laptop with 4GB RAM, and doing my daily tasks in Windows often led to a lot of performance issues. After distro-hopping for a while, I found out about Arch Linux and its godly speed. I loved it. But setting it up is an absolute pain. However, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall">archinstall</a> script makes it much easier. Gaining inspiration from that script, I thought to make one myself, tailored precisely to my own needs. Therefore, I made <a href="https://www.github.com/Dekta92/Archsetup">this</a>.

            I really, really get annoyed with repetitive, mundane tasks. When I'm playing games, there's usually some sort of quest that you have to mindlessly grind over and over before you can move on to the next stage. And macro software that I found is pretty annoying to get working or doesn't record your keyboard and mouse to the level of accuracy that I want to it to be at. To fix that, I made this macro. This is currently only for Xorg desktops in Linux because it's made using the X11 library.
